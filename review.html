                    <p>I absolutely loved the mountain everest climb. It was very interesting. A little bit chilly but they also provided me with all 
                       the necessities needed and stuck to their word. I have rated it 5 stars because it is the cheapest and most reliable service 
                       ever provided with and i enjoyed every step of the way 100%. I would recommend going because I myself have been planning to 
                       go on the Sahara Dessert Trip as a part of my fitness. Good Job NCC AVIATION keep it up.

                    <p>I loved the community found amongst this group. I joined the Carribean tour and if i had to say I had a blast. One that I wont
                        be seeing without NCC AVIATION. The lunch, the trip, and the midnight conversations and stories along the beach of the 
                        Carribean. Ohhhh how I wish I could go again and enjoy the experience again. I didnt like the fish food so I'm going to give
                        it 3 stars but dont get it twisted. Best services I have ever experienced 10/10.

                    <p>I went on the Sahara Dessert trip for a change in my fitness routine. I have lost alot of pounds ever since I left since the walk
                        is pumped with energy and the scorching sun. I would certainly recommend this service to anyone who wants to lose weight or is 
                        just facinated by the creation of God and wants to explore but one thing I do want to suggets. Check with your local doctor if 
                        you can take this trip and it wont effect your health as there was an old lady that fainted but NCC AVIATION swooped in and saved
                        the day with their top notch services. Congratulations to you NCC AVIATON, there will be alot more trips coming from me.

                    <p>I have had one of the best drone services from this company. They fixed up my drone that I thought would have no chance in surviving
                        but they revived it and made it good as new. I bought it from their services so they also gave me a FREE FIX!!! It came in handy 
                        because im money tight and I needed this drone for my work purposes. I rate their services a great 5 stars. If i could rate it 
                        higher believe me I would and i recommend their services as staff was very helpful and welcoming. Ill be using their services more
                        in the future. Good Job NCC AVIATION.
