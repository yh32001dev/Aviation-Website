                <h3>Mount Everest</h3>
                <img src="images/mount-everest.jpeg" alt="mounteverest-pic">
                <p>Mount Everest? Whats so special about this mountain compared to other mountains? Well for a fact
                    its the largest mountain found on the face of the earth. The harsh conditions at the top make it
                    impossible for humans to inhabit but who said it cant be climbed and conquered? 2 months work of 
                    climbing and seeing a bunch of animals and new temperetures you probably never knew existed. NCC
                    AVIATION has branches into the journey for those who differ in their journey up the mount. Those 
                    who only want to climb as a beginnner would be in a specific group, intermidiate climbers will be
                    with experienced climbers and Experts will climb with High leveled constructors due to the height 
                    and danger they will take part in. As said before, NCC will take care of your basic needs needed
                    to take on this exciting challenge. Some of the best instructors found all over the world have come
                    together to help climbers reach their goals which they decided to come with. Saftey measures will be
                    given before and after the climb.
