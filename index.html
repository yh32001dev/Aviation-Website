                <h2>Types of Drones That We deal With</h2>
                <h3>DJI AIR 2S</h3>
                <img src="images/drone1.jpeg" alt="drone-DJI">
                <p>The outstanding Air 2S combines the best features of our previous favorite DJI drones, the Mavic Air 2 and 
                    Mavic 2 Pro. You get the former's compact, folding design as well as the latter's 20MP 1-Inch sensor. The
                    combination is brilliant, making the Air 2S our top pick for both hobbyists and professionals looking for
                    a small drone that they can take anywhere.While the Mavic Air 2 is still a good choice for those on a tighter
                    budget, the Air 2S offers some useful advantages over its predecessor. The ability to shoot 5.4K video at 30fps
                    gives you more creative freedom and supports a useful digital zoom option (though we recommend only using
                    it at 2x zoom). Include</p>
                <br>
                <h3>DJI Mavic Mini</h3>
                <img class="imgright" src="images/dji2-drone.jpeg" alt="drone-DJI2">
                <p>One of our few concerns about the DJI Mavic Mini was that it couldn't shoot 4K video â€“ this excellent successor 
                    corrects that while also providing us with a few extra treats. The Mini 2 retains its ultra-compact design, 
                    making it the joint-smallest drone in DJI's lineup, but it now includes a new controller that increases range
                     (thanks to Ocusync 2.0 connectivity) and provides a more polished flying experience.It, like the Mavic Mini,
                      comes with a plethora of beginner-friendly QuickShot modes that allow the drone to perform pre-programmed moves
                      . But, thanks to the inclusion of raw photo shooting and 4K video, the Mini 2 offers more for pro photographers 
                      as well.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>DJI Mavic 3</h3>
                <img src="images/drone-3.jpeg" alt="drone-3">
                <p>Looking for the most powerful compact drone on the market? It's the DJI Mavic 3. This aerial powerhouse is outfitted
                     with a dual-camera system that combines a large, 20MP Four Thirds sensor with a useful 162mm telephoto lens. And the
                      Mavic 3 packs all of this into a backpack-friendly package that's lighter than the Mavic 2 Pro model it's based on.
                      Other enhancements over its predecessor include a 46-minute battery life (equivalent to about half an hour of actual 
                      flight time) and the ability to shoot 5K/50p video or 4K/120p slow-mo footage. Upgrade to the DJI Mavic 3 Cine bundle 
                      for 1TB of internal storage, a fancy DJI RC Pro controller, and the ability to shoot video in Apple ProRes 422 HQ format.

                <br>
                <p>We also provide any maintanance problems for the drones, if they were purchased from NCC AVIATION then we will give
                    our customers a discount. If drones are purchased outside any of our facilities then they should come with their
                    spare parts if it is not in our specified category of drones.
